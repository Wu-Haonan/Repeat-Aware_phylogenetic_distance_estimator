# Repeat_Aware_phylogenetic_distance_estimator

This tool efficiently estimates phylogenetic distances and constructs a Neighbor-Joining (NJ) tree among multiple reference or assembly genomes in parallel. It is based on the [Repeat-Aware Substitution Rate Estimator](https://github.com/medvedevgroup/Repeat-Aware_Substitution_Rate_Estimator) and [Repeat-Aware Mutation Rate Estimator](https://github.com/Wu-Haonan/Repeat-Aware_mutation_rate_estimator), leveraging the power of **KMC** for k-mer counting and **sourmash** for sketching.
